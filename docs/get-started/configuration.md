# Configuration
Create an `expanded-singles.php` file under your `/config` directory with the following options available to you. You can also use multi-environment options to change these per environment.

The below shows the defaults already used by Expanded Singles, so you don't need to add these options unless you want to modify the values.

```php
<?php

return [
    'expandSingles' => true,
    'redirectToEntry' => false,
];
```

## Configuration options
- `expandSingles` - Expands the Singles link on the Entries' page to list them like Channels and Structures.
- `redirectToEntry` - Automatically redirects to edit the Single Entry when clicking on the item in the sidebar.

## Control Panel
You can also manage configuration settings through the Control Panel by visiting Settings â†’ Expanded Singles.
