# Expanded Singles
A simple plugin for Craft CMS that alters the Entries Index sidebar to list all Singles, rather than grouping them under a 'Singles' link.

Functionality can be turned off without uninstalling the plugin, reverting to the original layout.

Clicking on a Single in the menu will re-load the main index table with your lone Single. To go straight to editing the single, turn on the 'Redirect to Entry' option in the plugin settings.
